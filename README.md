## Pre requisites

* Recommended to use a system of 4 GB RAM (Don't worry, we can still make it work). 

* Although you can work on any platform (Windows, Mac OSX, Linux), a **Debian** based operating system (Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Kali) is preferred. You can also install a docker container for Ubuntu 16.04 if you are comfortable with Linux (Optional).

    ```
    docker pull ubuntu
    docker run ubuntu:16.04 grep -v '^#' /etc/apt/sources.list
    docker run -it ubuntu:16.04 /bin/bash
 
    ```
    Run this inside the docker container:

    `$ apt-get install software-properties-common`
    
* Install a python interpreter >= 3.5.
   
* It would be great if you also setup a latest version of `nodejs` and `npm`. Here is a [install guide](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-node-js-on-ubuntu-16-04) for Ubuntu system.
